//To get the text and put it in a file with a .ass extension using JavaScript, you can use the following code:
const fs = require('fs');

// Get the text
const text = 'This is some sample text.';

// Write the text to a file with .ass extension
fs.writeFile('file.ass', text, (err) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log('The file has been saved!');
});

// This code uses the `fs` module in Node.js to write the `text` variable to a file named `file.ass`. If there is an error while writing the file, it will be thrown and logged to the console. Otherwise, a success message will be logged to the console.
